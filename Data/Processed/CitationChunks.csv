These fields help construct an analysis of the Africana experience, the historical and current relationship of African Americans to the larger society, and the sociopolitical problems that often resulted from Black/white interactions. In this course, students will be introduced to the concepts and methods of the discipline of Africana Studies, and will use them to study select narratives, data, and or text derived from and or related to African world experience, with particular emphasis on the period of late modernity (1500 to the present). As such, this course provides students with an alternative to traditional Western orthodoxy by exploring new and alternative paradigms and theories. Although extensive, this course is not a comprehensive approach to the Africana experience, but rather an introductory examination designed to immerse students in the history and culture of Africans and the African continent, the history of African Americans, and the Africana experience throughout the Diaspora.

Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event! Some of you will also need to attend the Association of Southeastern Biologists meeting, which is usually mid-March. Those of you who do this will not be required to work as much during the actual event in April and will serve more as team leaders during the actual event. Spring semesters. Junior standing.

The Spring Wildflower Pilgrimage in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), which began in 1951, is the oldest and largest public outreach event of its kind in the US. Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event! Some of you will also need to attend the Association of Southeastern Biologists meeting, which is usually mid-March. Those of you who do this will not be required to work as much during the actual event in April and will serve more as team leaders during the actual event. Spring semesters. Junior standing. May be registered as ESC 4260, BIOL 4260, or GEOL 4260. Effective Spring 2026."

For instance, students will investigate the historical significance of the 1906 lynching of Ed Johnson, explore the city’s musical heritage with the arrival of Blues singer Bessie Smith, study urban renewal initiatives such as the Golden Gateway Project and its devastating impact on underserved communities, learn about the 1982 federal civil suit which set important precedent holding the perpetrators of hate crimes accountable in the wake of the Ku Klux Klan members’ violent attack on five African American women, and examine Volkswagen’s labor union disputes at the intersection of business culture and masculinity. Unpacking these and other important historical episodes that intersect with race, law, culture, and urban politics, students will better understand how Chattanooga as a city made and helps remake the narrative of the United States as a nation. Course readings, assignments, and experiential learning activities place particular emphasis on the city’s history of racism and anti-racist activism, community organizing around LGBTQ issues, gentrification, and environmental concerns, as well as working-class and union struggles.

The course offers students opportunities to explore the diverse ways historians approach preserving and interpreting history and displaying historical research and topics to public audiences. Public historians practice history in a variety of settings. They may work as museum curators and educators, historic site interpreters, archivists, oral historians, community activists, film and digital media producers, or historic preservationists. They may be employed at nonprofit organizations, cultural institutions, corporations, government agencies, or as independent consultants. In working within these settings, public historians must be able to adapt their techniques and goals to the particular tasks while keeping the communities they serve in mind. The diverging purposes of each unique task and community leads public historians to constantly consider new questions and sources. Therefore, students in the course will also learn about the challenges and rewards of working collaboratively within communities of professionals and non-professionals in order to challenge past interpretations and provide avenues for new research and voices in the historical landscape.

Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries. This class will give students an opportunity to learn about some of these experiences, and to consider the methods that historians might use to uncover those queer histories that have yet to be told. Lecture 3 hours. May be registered as WGSS 3425. No credit in both HIST 3425 and WGSS 3425."

East Asian countries shared religious traditions, experiences with imperialism, the central role of women and the construction of gender in modernity, and the physical movement of women and men among these countries. However, they also have differences. This course will explore changes over time in sexualities, work experiences, the gendered state, and marriage and family in East Asia. The focus will be on China, Japan, and Korea, with a brief discussion on Okinawa and Taiwan. Page: 1 <- Back 10 … 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 … Forward 10 -> 26"

What is history? What is memory? How does history shape memory? How does memory shape history? This course will attempt to answer these questions by covering the history of the war and the postwar era with an emphasis on how postwar history shaped the memories of World War II in East Asia. How have different people in different social and temporal contexts remembered the war and understood its significance, such as through films and in museums? How have memories differed from group to group, such as feminists and ultranationalists? How have they changed over time? In what ways are the memories of the war made meaningful for the present? How do these memories influence relations between Japan and other countries in the postwar and contemporary periods? We will examine how these processes have unfolded primarily in East Asia, namely China, Japan, Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan."

It does so through a close examination of two dominant Middle Eastern powers—Iran and Israel. In addition to achieving a greater understanding of those countries and of the Middle East more broadly, students who complete this course will learn how to synthesize that body of historical knowledge, to identify and utilize the elements of effective argumentation, and to use that knowledge to formulate cogent and compelling arguments of their own regarding the most important issues facing the countries of that region. The course’s main themes and topics include the emergence of the modern Middle Eastern state system and the formation of national identity; the role of religion in politics and public life; the relationship between state and society; the nature of legitimate rule; and the role of the United States in the Middle East, especially in addressing issues of human rights in Iran and Israel-Palestine.

8d8e976a87f0b6fc,ART 3130,"Course Descriptions - University of Tennessee, Chattanooga2.pdf",5,description,"This course surveys the cultural production of African American artists from the mid-eighteenth century to the present day. It examines the range of visual media–including, but not limited to, paintings, decorative arts, sculptures, prints, photographs, clothing, and performance–produced by Black artists from the time of enslavement through the Black Lives Matter movement. Particular attention is given to the styles, aesthetics, social contexts, political motivations, ideological underpinnings, and gendered nature of this history. This course prioritizes the production of peoples of African descent within the United States, although depictions of Black subjects by white Euro-American artists are occasionally considered for contextual purposes. It also explores how the field of “African American art history” has been defined in relation to Euro-American cultural history and investigates both the advantages and disadvantages of this formation. This class is designed to advance students’ visual acuteness, cross-cultural awareness, critical thinking, application, and skills of writing and interpretation. Every other Fall semester."

Students work closely with the professor, curators from the museum/institution, and library professionals to learn about archival research, curatorial management, interpretive label writing, and exhibition design. The semester culminates in a small collaborative exhibition and the results of the students’ research are added to the museum/institution’s curatorial file.Every other Fall semester.

Art is a cultural product—something created by human intention and design, while nature is thought to be occurring of its own accord—something that exists independently of human design and control. However, over time, the intermingling of nature and culture has become increasingly complex, and this has important consequences for both society and ecological systems. This course explores significant philosophies of art and nature in the history of philosophy and/or contemporary theories of environmental aesthetics and the role of art in environmental movements in order to understand these consequences more deeply."

We begin the class by first asking the not-so-simple question: what is democracy? Next, we turn to the historical process of democratization in America. Relying on insights from research on American political development, we analyze critical moments in the struggle for political inclusion, emphasizing the dynamic between citizenship claims, political economy, and institutional arrangements of the American state from the founding to the mid-twentieth century. We then take a critical look at the rise of partisan polarization, “us vs. them” tribal politics, and the strategic use of minoritarian governing institutions and “hardball constitutionalism.” Finally, we review and assess the impact of potential democratic reforms, including Supreme Court expansion, changes to Senate procedure, a new voting rights act, statehood for DC and Puerto Rico, and increased democratic control of the economy.

Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries.

Training will go beyond memorizing names and focus on keying out species in scientific manuals; (2.) gain experience with how to identify, treat, and document several rare species in the Southern Appalachians; (3.) learn how to properly collect, document, and process (press, dry, label, mount, file) plant specimens from the field and build the collections at both UTC and HBS. In doing this we will also collect non-rare plant species in multiples to produce duplicate specimens for exchange, which will further build the UTC herbarium; (4.) learn how to properly use an herbarium/museum for aid in scientific determination of species and as a resource to understand the threatened and endangered species of a study area; (5.) learn the major ecological systems in our area; and (6.) learn basic plant community surveying techniques.

The Spring Wildflower Pilgrimage in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), which began in 1951, is the oldest and largest public outreach event of its kind in the US. Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event! Some of you will also need to attend the Association of Southeastern Biologists meeting, which is usually mid-March. Those of you who do this will not be required to work as much during the actual event in April and will serve more as team leaders during the actual event. Spring semesters. Junior standing.
