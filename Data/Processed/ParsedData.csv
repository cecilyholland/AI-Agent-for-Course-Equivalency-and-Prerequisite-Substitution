This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event!

HIST 3425,HIST,3425,,Queer American History,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"While terms like gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex have relatively recent origins, the contemporary LGBTQ+ community has deep historical roots in America. Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries. This class will give students an opportunity to learn about some of these experiences, and to consider the methods that historians might use to uncover those queer histories that have yet to be told.

How have memories differed from group to group, such as feminists and ultranationalists? How have they changed over time? In what ways are the memories of the war made meaningful for the present? How do these memories influence relations between Japan and other countries in the postwar and contemporary periods?

HIST 4810,HIST,4810,,Debating the Middle East,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"This course introduces students to the history, politics, and debates that have shaped the modern Middle East. It does so through a close examination of two dominant Middle Eastern powers—Iran and Israel. In addition to achieving a greater understanding of those countries and of the Middle East more broadly, students who complete this course will learn how to synthesize that body of historical knowledge, to identify and utilize the elements of effective argumentation, and to use that knowledge to formulate cogent and compelling arguments of their own regarding the most important issues facing the countries of that region. The course’s main themes and topics include the emergence of the modern Middle Eastern state system and the formation of national identity; the role of religion in politics and public life; the relationship between state and society; the nature of legitimate rule; and the role of the United States in the Middle East, especially in addressing issues of human rights in Iran and Israel-Palestine.

WGSS 3425,WGSS,3425,,Queer American History,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"While terms like gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex have relatively recent origins, the contemporary LGBTQ+ community has deep historical roots in America. Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries. This class will give students an opportunity to learn about some of these experiences, and to consider the methods that historians might use to uncover those queer histories that have yet to be told.

It is also designed to give experiences to those looking to fields such as environmental consultant or employee of environmental governmental organizations (e.g., TVA, NFS, NPS, State Parks). The primary objectives of this course are to: (1.) learn common native and naturalized vascular plant species of our region and to learn how to properly identify these species. Training will go beyond memorizing names and focus on keying out species in scientific manuals; (2.) gain experience with how to identify, treat, and document several rare species in the Southern Appalachians; (3.) learn how to properly collect, document, and process (press, dry, label, mount, file) plant specimens from the field and build the collections at both UTC and HBS. In doing this we will also collect non-rare plant species in multiples to produce duplicate specimens for exchange, which will further build the UTC herbarium; (4.) learn how to properly use an herbarium/museum for aid in scientific determination of species and as a resource to understand the threatened and endangered species of a study area; (5.) learn the major ecological systems in our area; and (6.) learn basic plant community surveying techniques.

Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event! Some of you will also need to attend the Association of Southeastern Biologists meeting, which is usually mid-March.
