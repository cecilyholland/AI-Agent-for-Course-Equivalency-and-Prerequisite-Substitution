Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event!

HIST 2470,HIST,2470,,Chattanooga History: From Scenic City to Gig City,CZ or HF,3.0,3.0,,Individual and Global Citizenship or Humanities and Fine Arts,,,,,"In the course of Chattanooga’s past, contemporaries have assigned different labels to capture the city’s ongoing evolution: “Dynamo of Dixie,” “Dirtiest City in America,” “Scenic City,” and “Gig City.” This course traces Chattanooga’s history from the dispossession of Cherokee lands during Trail of Tears to the defining Civil War battles to the implementation of urban revitalization projects to the rise of high-tech manufacturing. For instance, students will investigate the historical significance of the 1906 lynching of Ed Johnson, explore the city’s musical heritage with the arrival of Blues singer Bessie Smith, study urban renewal initiatives such as the Golden Gateway Project and its devastating impact on underserved communities, learn about the 1982 federal civil suit which set important precedent holding the perpetrators of hate crimes accountable in the wake of the Ku Klux Klan members’ violent attack on five African American women, and examine Volkswagen’s labor union disputes at the intersection of business culture and masculinity. Unpacking these and other important historical episodes that intersect with race, law, culture, and urban politics, students will better understand how Chattanooga as a city made and helps remake the narrative of the United States as a nation. Course readings, assignments, and experiential learning activities place particular emphasis on the city’s history of racism and anti-racist activism, community organizing around LGBTQ issues, gentrification, and environmental concerns, as well as working-class and union struggles.

The course offers students opportunities to explore the diverse ways historians approach preserving and interpreting history and displaying historical research and topics to public audiences. Public historians practice history in a variety of settings. They may work as museum curators and educators, historic site interpreters, archivists, oral historians, community activists, film and digital media producers, or historic preservationists. They may be employed at nonprofit organizations, cultural institutions, corporations, government agencies, or as independent consultants. In working within these settings, public historians must be able to adapt their techniques and goals to the particular tasks while keeping the communities they serve in mind. The diverging purposes of each unique task and community leads public historians to constantly consider new questions and sources. Therefore, students in the course will also learn about the challenges and rewards of working collaboratively within communities of professionals and non-professionals in order to challenge past interpretations and provide avenues for new research and voices in the historical landscape.

HIST 3425,HIST,3425,,Queer American History,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"While terms like gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex have relatively recent origins, the contemporary LGBTQ+ community has deep historical roots in America. Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries. This class will give students an opportunity to learn about some of these experiences, and to consider the methods that historians might use to uncover those queer histories that have yet to be told.

PHIL 4950,PHIL,4950,,Topics in Philosophies of Art & Nature,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"Though they are often thought of in opposition, art and nature and deeply intertwined, both conceptually and in practice. Art is a cultural product—something created by human intention and design, while nature is thought to be occurring of its own accord—something that exists independently of human design and control. However, over time, the intermingling of nature and culture has become increasingly complex, and this has important consequences for both society and ecological systems. This course explores significant philosophies of art and nature in the history of philosophy and/or contemporary theories of environmental aesthetics and the role of art in environmental movements in order to understand these consequences more deeply.","Course Descriptions - University of Tennessee, Chattanooga21.pdf",6,af50d90c4dcc8beec8f4462a99be9594|1c9abbbee743d15fcd63a4d45d44c6da|2bb5ca1360e1751183ef9828bbc1001a

Spanning from the seventeenth century to the present, this course explores the past experiences of individuals and groups who would be categorized today under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. It examines the long history of protest and political action that sexual minorities have undertaken in pursuit of civil rights and social justice, as well as the consistent legal and cultural backlash that has accompanied LGBTQ+ visibility. As we shift our focus from decade to decade, we will observe the ever-evolving ideas about what was “natural” and “normal” when it came to gender and sexual identity, and we will consider the many social forces shaping popular opinion on sexual matters (e.g. the press, lawmakers, scientists, religious figures, authors, filmmakers, etc.). Throughout the semester we will examine queer history within an intersectional framework; that is to say, we will contemplate the wide array of identities that constituted our subjects’ lived experiences, including race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and region. As we shall see, there has not been one uniform queer experience in the United States. Rather, there are countless factors that have shaped the lives of queer Americans throughout the centuries. This class will give students an opportunity to learn about some of these experiences, and to consider the methods that historians might use to uncover those queer histories that have yet to be told.

It is also designed to give experiences to those looking to fields such as environmental consultant or employee of environmental governmental organizations (e.g., TVA, NFS, NPS, State Parks). The primary objectives of this course are to: (1.) learn common native and naturalized vascular plant species of our region and to learn how to properly identify these species. Training will go beyond memorizing names and focus on keying out species in scientific manuals; (2.) gain experience with how to identify, treat, and document several rare species in the Southern Appalachians; (3.) learn how to properly collect, document, and process (press, dry, label, mount, file) plant specimens from the field and build the collections at both UTC and HBS.

Each year more than 200 educational programs are created and more than 100 leaders are organized to educate approximately 1000 people over four days in what has been called “natures greatest classroom,” the GSMNP. This class will not be based on exercises and examples, but actually building, working for, and attending the event. The course will begin with an overview of the Pilgrimage and we will get right to work assembling the Program and advertising its launch by mid- February, advertising and opening registration in March, and then all students will be required to attend and assist with the event during a week in April (although we will make a schedule so students are not working the entire week, have time to attend programs of interest, and take some personal time). Lodging in Gatlinburg, TN as well as three meals a day during the event will be provided for students in this class, and we can schedule time off for exams that need to be taken and for you to attend some of the event! Some of you will also need to attend the Association of Southeastern Biologists meeting, which is usually mid-March.
